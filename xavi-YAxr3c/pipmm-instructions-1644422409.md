---

If you are seeing this in the browser for first time... Congratulations! you made it very far! The installation seems to be working :)
The following is a set of instructions to guide you for how to start using PIPMM.

The get a better understanding of what is going on open the  "abstractions-template" repository that you just clonned with Visual Studio Code

Look for the following file in VS Code:
- Open the "search by name command" using `ctrl + p`
- Type in "hello-world-1644425608"

Now, save that file. Just `ctrl + s`

The browser should have been updated rendering the Hello World file.

Now you play around...
